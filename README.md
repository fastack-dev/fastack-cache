# fastack-cache

fastack-cache is a caching plugin for fastack ❤️

This plugin is inspired by the [django cache framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/cache/) and [django-redis](https://github.com/jazzband/django-redis)!

Currently only supports ``redis`` as cache backend.
And the plan in the future there will be ``aioredis`` and ``memcached`` as cache backends!

# Installation

```
pip install fastack-cache
```
